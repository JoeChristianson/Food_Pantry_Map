# YouFoods ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellowgreen) 

For this application, we created an online website in which users can track, contribute to, and set up various food shelves. Immediately upon loading the website, a map is generated using google maps that centers on the users location. Various cherry markers pop up that show nearby food shelters that other users have created. Clicking a marker will display information about that particular food shelf like its name, address, and the supplies that it needs. Users can choose to register and create a username and password that are stored within the application's database. They can use this login information to create a new food shelter and request supplies. A new marker will then be generated for the address that they provided. For each food shelf created, the user that created it can edit and post new requests that are then updated on their marker information.
